# Portfolio-DSC


# Motivation

This is a portfolio, which is based on me, my skills , my hobbies and my contact.

# Components

## HTML (HTML5) => 
Have used HTML to put the content inside the website.

## CSS (CSS3) => 
It is used to add a layout to certain sections of the website and beautify some elements.

## Javascript => 
I have used javascript to add interactivity to the page by using it’s cool features of manipulating the DOM. It was also used to add typing effect and to implement Local Storage.

## Bootstrap(Bootstrap 4.5) => 
The basic layout of the webpages were made by using bootstrap and it’s components. This is used to add responsiveness to the website on different viewports. Also different features like nav-pills, bootstrap cards, modals etc were used from Bootstrap 4.5.

## PHP (PHP 7.2) => 
I have used PHP so that I can add a mailing function to the website which will send a mail to the users who will fill the form on the contact page.

## Local Storage => 
I have used this tool to store user data without any involvement of the backend. The data is stored in web browser storage and then the saved data is used for displaying the modal on the success page which appears after the form has been filled and also to send mails.

## CSS Animations => 
I have used this to emphasize on certain elements on my website and beautify them using different effects and animations. Implemented different types of text and image animations on different pages.

## JQuery => 
I have used Jquery to call a function when all the contents of the DOM of the page have been loaded (Success page) .The function causes the popping up of modal on whenever the page is loaded.

## Git and Github => 
This has been used in order for pushing and storing all the files of source code in the master branch and updating the README.md file for referrals.

## 000webhost => 
000webhost provides hosting services to my website as it includes a PHP mail handler that is not provided on github pages.
